# AntiForensikProtection
This tool is designed to provide protection against forensic methods when you have to leave your PC alone

This tool allows you to leave your PC unlocked without others being able to do anything. To unlock, simply enter the password in the correct order. You will NOT see an input field while entering the password.

If a mouse click is made or an invalid key is pressed, which is not the password, the PC switches off.

Modes:
1. safe mode: If this is activated, the mouse may not be moved and no USB data carriers may be added
2. black mode: Here the screen is black

Supported systems: Linux, Windows and Apple Darwin (not tested)

There is no guarantee. Please report any errors.
